## Basic usage

### Running with job script
Carry out local job (local training / local inference / local interaction) with a configuration file. You can specify GPU by `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=XXX` in `./scripts/local/job.sh`. You can also specify other environment variables in the script.

``` bash
./scripts/local/job.sh ${JOB_CONF}
```

- An example of training configuration files is `./package/dialog_en/24L_train.conf`. It contains three sections: `job`, `task` and `training`.
- An example of inference configuration files is `./package/dialog_en/24L_infer.conf`. It contains three sections: `job`, `task` and `inference`.
- An example of interaction configuration files is `./package/dialog_en/24L_interact.conf`. It contains three sections: `job`, `task` and `interaction`.
- An example of self-chat configuration files is `./package/dialog_en/self_chat.conf`. It contains three sections: `job`, `task` and `self-chat`.
- An example of running chitchat server configuration files is `./package/dialog_en/run_server.conf`.

#### job
This section is mostly used in a paddlecloud job.

This section defines:
- `job_script`: the main script of this task.
    - `./scripts/single_gpu/train.sh`: single GPU training
    - `./scripts/distributed/train.sh`: distributed GPU training (NCCL required).
    - `./scripts/single_gpu/infer.sh`: single GPU inference
    - `./scripts/distributed/infer.sh`: distributed GPU inference on single machine, and it will merge different inference results on each GPU.
    - `./scripts/single_gpu/interact.sh`: running interaction with a dialogue model

#### k8s
This section is related to using Knover in PaddleCloud.

This section defines:
- `task_name`: this will be used as the job name in PaddleCloud.
- `queue`: the group which you want to submit.
- `nodes`: the number of nodes will be used in this job.
- `cards`: the number of cards will be used in each node.
- `permission`: the permission of this job.
- `fs_name && fs_ugi` && `output_path`: the output of this job will be saved in the hdfs/afs cluster (`fs_name` and `fs_ugi`).
- It also supports other settings for a paddlecloud job (see more information in this [script](../scripts/paddlecloud/k8s_submit.sh)).

#### afs
If you want to mount a directionary on an AFS cluster to the PaddleCloud machine, you need to define this section.

- `afs_fs_name`: an URL, the path name of AFS cluster.
- `afs_fs_ugi`: the UGI of the AFS cluster.
- `remote_mount_point`: the remote path on AFS cluster you want to mount.
- `local_mount_point`: the local path on the PaddleCloud machine.

#### hdfs
If you want to download additional data from another HDFS (or AFS) cluster, you need to define thish section.

- `hdfs_path`: an URL, the path name of cluster.
- `hdfs_ugi`: the UGI of the cluster.
- `hdfs_python_package`: the path of used python package on cluster.
- `hdfs_init_model`: the path of used pre-trained model on cluster.
- `hdfs_files`: the path of files on cluster.

#### task
This section defines:
- `model`: the model used in specify task, such as
    - `UnifiedTransformer`: used in the `DialogGeneration` task
    - `Plato`: used in the `DialogGeneration` task
    - `NSPModel`: used in the `NextSentencePrediction` task
- `task`: task name, such as
    - `DialogGeneration`: generating a response for the given context.
    - `NextSentencePrediction`: judging whether the sentence is the next sentence follows given context.
- `vocab_path`: vocabulary path
- tokenizer related: `spm_model_file` for [SentencePieces](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) Tokenizer, and so on.
- `config_path`: the model configuration file.
- dataset files related: `train_file` / `valid_file` (for training), `infer_file` (for inference), `data_format` and `file_format`.
- Choices of `data_format`:
    - `raw`: untokenized data tsv file, example: `./data/example/train.tsv`, each column is a field.
    - `tokenized`: tokenized data tsv, example: `./data/example/train_tokenized.tsv` which is generated by `./knover/tools/pre_tokenized.sh`.
    - `numerical`: each line contains numerical data (`token_ids`, `type_ids` and `pos_ids`) , example: `./data/example/train.numerical.tsv` which is generated by `./knover/tools/pre_numericalize.sh`.
- Choices of `file_format`:
    - `file`: a file only.
    - `filelist`: containing multiple files, where each line is a file, example: `./data/example/train_filelist`.
- It also supports the file with `.gz` suffix which is compressed by `gzip` command.

#### training
This section defines training related settings:
- `init_params`: initialized parameters.
- `init_checkpoint`: initialized checkpoints (containing not only the parameters of the model, but also the persitables of the optimizer) . You can also set `train_args="--start_step 1000"` for better display of log (when you continue the training from step 1000) , but this is not necessary.
- `batch_size`, `lr`, `num_epochs` and so on.
- `log_dir`: the output path of training logs, including the log file (`${log_dir}/workerlog.${DEV_ID}`) of each GPU trainer.
- `save_path`: the output path of saved parameters.
- You can define other arguments in training configuration, such as:

```
train_args="--max_src_len 384 --max_seq_len 512"
```

- You can find more arguments in `knover/tasks/${TASK_NAME}.py` and `knover/models/${MODEL_NAME}.py`.

#### inference
This section defines inference related settings:
- `init_params`: initialized parameters.
- `nsp_init_params`: initialized NSP model parameters to re-rank candidate responses.
- `batch_size`, `in_tokens` and so on.
- `output_name`: the name of output field.
- `save_path`: the output path of inference result.
- You can define other arguments in inference configuration, such as:

rerank by NSP score:

```
infer_args="--ranking_score nsp_score" # this will re-rank candidate responses by scores given by NSP model.
```

top-k sampling and rerank:

```
infer_args="--decoding_strategy topk_sampling --num_samples 20 --topk 10 --length_average true"
```

top-p sampling and rerank:

```
infer_args="--decoding_strategy topp_sampling --num_samples 20 --topp 0.9 --length_average true"
```

beam search:

```
infer_args="--decoding_strategy beam_search --beam_size 10 --length_average true"
```

- You can find more arguments in `knover/tasks/${TASK_NAME}.py` and `knover/models/${MODEL_NAME}.py`.

#### interaction
This section defines interaction related settings:
- `init_params`: initialized parameters.
- `nsp_init_params`: initialized NSP model parameters to re-rank candidate responses.
- You can define other arguments in interaction configuration, such as:

```
infer_args="--ranking_score nsp_score" # this will re-rank candidate responses by scores given by NSP model.
```

- You can find more arguments in `knover/tasks/${TASK_NAME}.py` and `knover/models/${MODEL_NAME}.py`.
